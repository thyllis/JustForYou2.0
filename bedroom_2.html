						I knew I should've gone home.<br>
						I should've cried myself to sleep in peace where no one could see me... but something just held me back to stay.<br>
						The hope things might still get better...<br><br>

						It didn't...<br><br>

						An act all night I could almost be proud of but my acting skills didn't have "deep emotional turmoil" covered so... *sob*<br>
						This went on all day the next day and it was EXHAUSTING.<br><br>

						The days that followed were bearable... some 60km away. Communication was a mess for days until the universe finally, finally took pity in the form of your sudden call.<br>
						So much joy, fear, and sadness in the span of a few rings of the phone.<br><br>

						Honestly, I really can't remember much of how that conversation went down but by the end of it we were pretty much back together so... yay!<br><br>
						(ok maybe not really but I was excited and determined to get my boyfriend back so shut up! hmph.)<br><br><br>
